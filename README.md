Expeiment 1 :- Linear Search : -








Linear search in C to find whether a number is present in an array. If it's present, then at what location it occurs. It is also known as a sequential search. It is straightforward and works as follows: we compare each element with the element to search until we find it or the list ends. Linear search for multiple occurrences and using a function.



The time complexity of above algorithm is O(n).

Linear search is rarely used practically because other search algorithms such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables allow significantly faster searching comparison to Linear search.




Experiment 2:-









Experiment 3:- write a program to implement singly linked list




Linked List
Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.
